**Your own AI assistant. On your laptop. In code you can read in an afternoon.**

Meet **Pikaka** — a local-first personal assistant that shows the four pillars behind every
serious agent: **Harness · Loop · Memory · Eval/LLM-Ops**. No frameworks hiding the good parts.
Built by [seanchen.io](https://seanchen.io).

- **Local-first.** Your memory is one SQLite file. Open it. Read it. It's yours.
- **Memory is the hero.** Semantic + episodic + procedural — with a gate that decides *whether*
  to remember, and a pass that decides *what* to keep.
- **The loop is ~95 lines** of plain Python. Step through it.
- **Watch it think.** A local dashboard lights up every message as it flows through the harness.
- **Eval built in.** Deterministic tests *and* LLM-as-judge, side by side, with a release gate.

### ☕️ [Buy me a coffee](https://buy.stripe.com/5kA176bA895ggog4gh) — it keeps this repo (and the videos) coming

## Quickstart

Just want to run it:

```bash
pip install pikaka-agent
pikaka                                    # talk to your Pikaka in the terminal
pikaka dashboard                          # …or the browser cockpit → localhost:7777
```

It will tell you which key to set the first time. Want to **read the code** (the
point of this repo) or contribute — clone it instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShenSeanChen/waku-agent && cd waku-agent
uv venv && uv pip install -e .          # create the env + install the `pikaka` command
cp .env.example .env                    # pick a provider, paste ONE key
uv run pikaka                             # talk to your Pikaka in the terminal
uv run pikaka dashboard                   # …or the browser cockpit → localhost:7777
```

`uv run pikaka …` needs **no venv activation**. Three ways to run it:

| Command | When |
|---|---|
| `uv run pikaka dashboard` | quick start, zero activation (recommended) |
| `source .venv/bin/activate` → `pikaka dashboard` | activate once, bare `pikaka` all session |
| `uv tool install .` → `pikaka dashboard` | install `pikaka` **globally**, forever |

`pikaka` and `pikaka dashboard` are two doors into the **same** Pikaka. The dashboard is a tiny web
server on *your* machine — chat in the browser, that process runs the turn. Nothing leaves your
laptop. Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and it starts your bot too. (`make dashboard` works as well.)

**Now try it.** *"Remember that Alex prefers morning meetings."* Quit. Restart.
*"Book a catch-up with Alex on Friday."* → it remembers, and books 9am. Your memory is one
file: `.pikaka/state.db`.

**Use the model you already pay for.** Anthropic (default), OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, MiniMax,
Kimi, GLM, OpenRouter (one key, hundreds of hosted models), OpenCode Zen, or OpenCode Go —
set `PIKAKA_PROVIDER=`, paste the key, done. One dialect in the loop;
a [~60-line adapter](pikaka/loop/models.py) handles the rest.

## Watch the harness run — the dashboard

```bash
pikaka dashboard          # starts a local server → http://localhost:7777
```

A small web server you own (`127.0.0.1`, no cloud). The browser is just the UI — the same
process runs every turn. This is the fastest way to *get* the system.

A chat dock sits on every tab. Type or **speak**, and watch it flow through the harness on the
Overview diagram: gate lights up → loop calls a tool → reply comes back → memory updates. The
frontend is plain static files. No build step.

Each tab is one pillar, linked to the real files:

| Tab | What you see |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | cost, latency, the gate skip/retrieve split, the clickable architecture map |
| **Gateway** | one conversation across every channel, each message tagged by source (dashboard / telegram / voice / cli) |
| **Loop** | every turn with its gate decision, tool calls, tokens, and cost |
| **Graph** | graph workflows: the live triage topology (drawn from the engine itself) + which door each turn took |
| **Memory** | sub-tabs per pillar — semantic facts, episodes, editable skills + SOUL, consolidation |
| **Tools** | the agent's available tools (grouped by origin), its results, and MCP connectors |
| **Data** | a live SQLite browser: per-table tabs, schema, and a read-only SQL console over `state.db` |
| **Ops** | eval verdict + history, the gate decisions, slowest turns, and inline JSONL traces |

The sidebar and chat dock are drag-resizable and hideable, and the chat has *New chat* +
history like any chat app.

## Things to try (each shows off a pillar)

Type these in the chat dock (or `make run`) and watch the dashboard light up:

| Try this | What it shows | Where to watch |
|---|---|---|
| *"Schedule a tennis game with Raj this Saturday at 8am"* | the Loop calls a tool (`create_event`) | the **LOOP** box pulses; **Loop** tab shows `iter 2` |
| *"What's on my calendar today?"* | reading the calendar (`list_events`) | it answers from `state.db`, no made-up events |
| *"When am I swimming with Sergey?"* then *"what's 12 × 8?"* | the **retrieval gate** — retrieve vs skip | Overview gate bar; **Ops** shows the per-turn decision |
| *"Remember that Raj prefers evening games"* | memory self-management (`save_note`) | **Memory ▸ Semantic** gains a fact; `MEMORY.md` updates |
| *"Search for the World Cup games still left to play and add each one to my calendar"* | **multi-tool loop engineering** | **Loop** tab shows `iter 8`: `search_web` × N → `create_event` × N |
| chat from `make run` **and** the browser | one brain, many gateways | the **Gateway** tab tags each message `cli` / `dashboard` |

**The money shot** is the World Cup one. In one turn, Pikaka searches the web a few times, reasons
over the results, and books every remaining match — **8 loop iterations**, live. Needs a free
`TAVILY_API_KEY` (paste it in **Connections**). Watch the **LOOP** box pulse per cycle. That's loop
engineering, on tape.

## How is this different from ChatGPT / Claude Desktop?

Those are products you *use*. This is a codebase you *own* — the loop, the memory schema, the
gate, the eval harness, all yours to read and change. Understand this repo, and you understand
what the products do under the hood.

Versus the big open-source assistants (OpenClaw, Hermes)? Same architecture, 1/100th the code.
Products vs. a readable blueprint.

Every whiteboard from the videos lives in [`docs/whiteboards/`](docs/whiteboards) as an
**editable `.excalidraw` source** — download one, drop it on [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com),
and remix it for your own team:

| Chart | What it explains |
|---|---|
| [`k3-architecture.excalidraw`](docs/whiteboards/k3-architecture.excalidraw) | Kimi K3: the 16-of-896 MoE, KDA + AttnRes attention, why agent loops get cheap |

New charts land here with every video. If they help you,
[a star](https://github.com/ShenSeanChen/waku-agent) keeps them coming — and
[sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/ShenSeanChen) gets new whiteboards early.

**A note on `MEMORY.md` vs `state.db`.** Some assistants (e.g. Hermes) keep long-term memory as a
single `MEMORY.md` markdown file. Pikaka keeps the *queryable* source in `state.db` (the `facts` and
`episodes` tables, keyword-searchable via FTS5) **and** regenerates a human-readable
`.pikaka/MEMORY.md` mirror after every turn — so you get both: a real file you can open, backed by a
sturdy database. The dashboard's **Memory** tab is the friendly view; the **Database** tab shows the
raw `state.db` tables.

## The Loop — reason → act → repeat

Yes, there's a real agent loop, and it's [~95 lines of plain Python](pikaka/loop/agent.py) —
no LangGraph, no hidden control flow (and when a task needs structure *around* the loop,
that structure is another ~200 readable lines — see
[Graph workflows](#graph-workflows--when-a-turn-needs-shape) below):

```
while not done:
    response = llm(messages, tools)      # reason
    if response wants tools:
        results = run(tool_calls)        # act
        messages += results              # observe
    else:
        done                             # reply to the human
```

Two guardrails end every turn: the model stops asking for tools (natural end), or it hits
`max_iterations` (hard stop — it never spins forever). That's "loop engineering": the exit
conditions, the tool round-trip, and feeding results back as working memory.

**How to show it on camera:**
1. Type *"schedule a swim with Sergey Saturday at 5pm"* in the chat dock and watch the **LOOP**
   box on the Overview diagram light up: reason → `create_event` → reason → reply.
2. Open the **Loop** tab — every turn is listed with its gate decision, each tool call, the
   **iteration count**, tokens, and dollar cost. A tool-using turn shows `iter 2` (reason,
   act, then reason again to reply); a plain answer shows `iter 1`.
3. Open the **Ops** tab (or `.pikaka/traces/<today>.jsonl`) to read that same turn as raw
   events in order: `turn_start → gate → llm → tool → llm → turn_end`. That's the loop, on tape.

**The multi-tool loop (the money shot).** One tool is a loop; *chaining* tools is where loop
engineering earns its name. Try:

> *"Search for the World Cup games still left to play and add each one to my calendar."*

The agent loops across two tools: [`search_web`](pikaka/tools/search.py) reads the web, it
reasons over the results, then calls [`create_event`](pikaka/tools/calendar.py) once per match —
several iterations in a single turn. You'll see `iter 4`, `iter 5`… on the Loop tab and the
LOOP box pulse for each cycle. `search_web` works keyless via DuckDuckGo but that endpoint
rate-limits bots, so for a clean take set a free `TAVILY_API_KEY` (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)).

## Graph workflows — when a turn needs shape

The loop is one agent turn: the model picks tools until it stops, and that covers chat.
But some work has **shape** — steps that could run *at the same time*, and explicit
"if this, go here" routing. A **graph workflow** makes that shape first-class: nodes
(each does one job — a function, one LLM call, or a whole loop turn) connected by edges
(what happens next). It's an extension of the Loop pillar, not a replacement:
[`loop/agent.py`](pikaka/loop/agent.py) did not change one line — a graph *arranges calls
around it, and to it*. And it's still no-framework: the entire engine is
[one readable file](pikaka/graph/engine.py), same trick as the loop.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph L["The loop — one path, step after step"]
    T["think"] --> A["act"] --> O["observe"] --> T
  end
  subgraph G["A graph workflow — a map of steps"]
    S(["START"]) --> C["classify<br/>small model"]
    S --> K["check calendar<br/>local read"]
    C --> R{"route"}
    K --> R
    R -. quick .-> Q["quick reply<br/>small model"] --> E(["END"])
    R -. full .-> F["full agent<br/>THE loop, as a node"] --> E
  end
```

**The shipped example: triage.** Flip `PIKAKA_GRAPH_WORKFLOWS=1` (in `.env`, or the
dashboard's Settings) and *every* message enters the triage graph first — you never
choose a mode, the harness decides. A small model classifies the message **while**
today's calendar loads in parallel; *"thanks!"* gets a fast small-model reply and never
wakes the big model; *"schedule a swim Saturday"* routes into the exact same loop as
before, running as one node. Any failure anywhere — classifier, engine, anything —
**fails open** to the plain loop, so the flag can only ever save time and tokens. This
is the retrieval-gate idea generalized from one gate to a structure. (A graph is *not*
a swarm of chatting agents: the edges decide everything, deterministically — which is
why it can be traced and eval'd like everything else here.)

**How to show it on camera:**
1. Switch the flag on, then send *"thanks!"* — on **Overview**, the graph panel lights
   the quick path while the LOOP boxes stay dark: proof the big model never woke.
2. Send *"schedule a swim Saturday 9am"* — watch `route → full_agent` light up, then the
   familiar loop animation take over. Same loop, one graph node.
3. Open the **Graph** tab: the live topology there is drawn from the engine's own
   `describe()` — the picture *cannot* drift from the code. The trace
   (`.pikaka/traces/<today>.jsonl`) shows the run on tape:
   `graph_start → node_start … route → graph_end`.

## The two hero moments

**1. The retrieval gate.** Most agents hit their memory store on every turn. That's
slow, and worse — irrelevant memories bias answers. Here a cheap model first answers
one question: *does this message need memory at all?* Watch it in the terminal:

```
you > what's 2+2?
  gate · skip — pure math
you > when am I meeting Alex?
  gate · retrieve — references user's plans
```

**2. Deterministic eval vs LLM-as-judge.** *"Did it create the right calendar event?"*
is a unit test — 0 or 1, no model judges it (`make eval`). *"Was the reply helpful?"*
is a judged score with a threshold (`make eval-judge`). Conflating the two is the most
common eval mistake; here they're separate suites you can diff. `make gate` runs both
as a release gate.

## Eval, tracing & catching bugs

Three commands, two kinds of eval — the LLM-Ops half of the system:

```bash
make eval          # deterministic: "did the right tool fire?" — 0 or 1, no model judges it
make eval-judge    # LLM-as-judge: "was the reply helpful?" — a scored %, needs a key
make gate          # the release gate: deterministic must pass 100%, judge must clear threshold
```

Deterministic tests are plain pytest in [`evals/deterministic/`](evals/deterministic); judged
ones use DeepEval in [`evals/judge/`](evals/judge). Keeping them apart is the whole point —
conflating "did it do the thing" (a unit test) with "was it any good" (a scored judgement) is
the most common eval mistake.

**Where the results show:** the terminal, and the dashboard's **Ops** tab — the release-gate
verdict, an **eval-history** table (one row per `make gate`, so you can see it grow), the actual
per-turn gate decisions, and the raw traces inline.

**The bug workflow (this is the discipline you show on camera):** when you catch a bug by using
the thing live, you fix it AND add a deterministic case so it can never come back. A real example
from this repo: the agent didn't know the current *time* and asked for it before scheduling
"in 30 minutes" → fixed in [`session.py`](pikaka/runtime/session.py), locked forever by
[`test_working_memory.py`](evals/deterministic/test_working_memory.py). Run `make gate` → green →
the eval history records the run.

**Spend is permanent:** every LLM call's tokens are appended to `.pikaka/usage.jsonl` — an
append-only ledger that a demo reset never wipes. The **Ops** tab shows the all-time cost, tokens,
and a per-day / per-provider breakdown (dollar cost is estimated from tokens, which are the ground
truth). So the number you show on camera is your real running total, not a per-session guess.

**Tracing is always on:** every turn appends readable lines to `.pikaka/traces/<date>.jsonl`
(zero setup) — a trace is just "what happened, in order." For span-waterfall views:

```bash
pip install -e '.[tracing]'
make trace                                            # Phoenix at localhost:6006
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317 make run
```

Langfuse cloud speaks the same OTel toggle.

## Connect it to your life

Voice, Telegram, Apple Calendar and Mail, Google Calendar, MCP servers — each
one is opt-in, behind its own extra, and none of them change the loop. Setup
for all of them: **[docs/integrations.md](docs/integrations.md)**.

## It manages its own memory

The agent has tools to keep itself useful — no black box:
- **manage_memory** — correct or forget a fact when you say it's wrong.
- **update_soul** — save a standing preference you give it (lives in `SOUL.md`).
- **create_skill** — when you teach it a repeatable workflow, it offers to save it
  as a skill (written to `.pikaka/skills/`, live the same session).

You can also edit any of this by hand on the dashboard's Memory tab (edit/delete
facts, rewrite `SOUL.md`) or in Settings (switch provider/model, paste keys — BYOK,
kept in your local `.env`, never sent to the browser).

## Add skills — yours or the community's

Skills are procedural memory: markdown instructions loaded only when relevant.

```bash
python -m pikaka skill install https://github.com/<someone>/<repo>/blob/main/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
```

**Contribute one — it's just a markdown file.** Copy [`skills/TEMPLATE.md`](skills/TEMPLATE.md),
PR it into [`skills/community/`](skills/community). CI validates the frontmatter.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Every command

The `pikaka` command is installed with the package; the `make` targets are equivalent aliases.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `pikaka` | chat in the terminal |
| `pikaka dashboard` | the live cockpit at localhost:7777 (+ Telegram if `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set) |
| `pikaka voice` | talk to it — hands-free "pikaka pikaka" (or push-to-talk) |
| `pikaka telegram` | message it from your phone (standalone) |
| `pikaka brief` | morning briefing from Calendar + Mail + memory |
| `make trace` | deep trace waterfalls (Phoenix) at localhost:6006 |
| `make eval` | deterministic evals (0/1, no judge) |
| `make eval-judge` | LLM-as-judge evals (scored %) |
| `make gate` | the release gate — both eval suites must pass |

## Roadmap — the whiteboard boxes beyond the flagship task

These live in [`pikaka/tools/experimental.py`](pikaka/tools/experimental.py), OFF by default —
`PIKAKA_EXPERIMENTAL=1` registers them.

**Sub-Agents is now LIVE.** `delegate_task` hands a coding job to
[pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) — Mario Zechner's minimal open-source coding agent —
through its headless print mode (`pi -p "task"`). Pikaka stays the orchestrator (memory, context,
evals); pi is the specialist contractor (read/bash/edit/write). Try it:

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
PIKAKA_EXPERIMENTAL=1 uv run pikaka
# "have pi fix the failing test in ~/my-project"
```

The full pi transcript lands in `.pikaka/outbox/delegate-*.log`; tune the budget with
`PIKAKA_DELEGATE_TIMEOUT` (default 300s).

The rest are still deliberate **skeletons** — the intent is drawn so the diagram maps to
something, but nothing is over-promised (they report "coming soon", and the dashboard's
**Tools** tab lists them under **Coming soon**):

| Whiteboard box | Tool | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Sub-Agents | `delegate_task` | **live** — delegates coding tasks to pi |
| Graph workflows | [`pikaka/graph/`](pikaka/graph) | **live** behind `PIKAKA_GRAPH_WORKFLOWS=1` — [triage-first turns](#graph-workflows--when-a-turn-needs-shape) |
| Terminal tool | `run_command` | skeleton — needs a real sandbox + safety surface first |
| Browser tool | `browse_web` | skeleton — `search_web` already covers read-only lookups |
| Cron Job | `schedule_task` | skeleton — `make brief` + a system cron line covers it today |

The point of a teaching repo is a readable core; these come alive one at a time, tested.

## Upgrade paths (when you outgrow the defaults)

| Default (zero setup) | Upgrade | How |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite FTS5 keyword memory | Supabase pgvector semantic search | `PIKAKA_SEMANTIC_STORE=supabase` + [sql/init_supabase.sql](sql/init_supabase.sql) — the exact schema from [launch-rag](https://github.com/ShenSeanChen/launch-rag)/[launch-agentic-rag](https://github.com/ShenSeanChen/launch-agentic-rag) |
| Mock calendar (ICS + SQLite) | Apple / Google Calendar | `PIKAKA_APPLE_CALENDAR=1` (macOS) or `PIKAKA_GOOGLE_CALENDAR=1` with `pip install -e '.[gcal]'` — the tool schema stays |
| Hand-built memory pillars | mem0 / Zep / LangMem | `pip install -e '.[arena]'` and set `PIKAKA_SEMANTIC_STORE` — then race them against each other in the Arena's Memory tab. [Where to see your memories in each provider's own console](docs/memory-backends-playbook.md) |
