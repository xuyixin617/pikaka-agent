"""A tiny, self-contained MCP server — the demo connector for pikaka-agent.

Most MCP examples need Node/npx. This one is pure Python (only the `mcp` extra),
so the connector story runs with zero extra installs:

    pip install -e '.[mcp]'
    cp examples/mcp.demo.json .pikaka/mcp.json
    make dashboard          # its tools appear under Tools > Available > MCP servers

Its tools register as `demo_word_count` and `demo_reverse_text`. Swap in your own
@mcp.tool() functions, or point mcp.json at any real MCP server the same way —
that's the whole point: connectors plug in without changing Pikaka's code.
