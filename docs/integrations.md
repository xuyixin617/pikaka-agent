# Connect it to your life

Everything here is opt-in and behind its own extra. None of it changes the
loop — a gateway moves text in and out, an integration is a tool the agent
may call. The four pillars work with none of this installed.

Moved out of the README, which had grown to 569 lines for a project whose
promise is that you can read it in an afternoon. Nothing was rewritten.

## Talk to it

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[voice]'
pikaka voice        # hands-free: always-listening for "pikaka pikaka"
```

**Hands-free by default.** `pikaka voice` listens for the wake word **"pikaka pikaka"** — a tiny
Whisper model scans the mic; when it hears the phrase, the big model takes over for your
command and speaks the reply. Change or disable it:

```bash
PIKAKA_WAKE_WORD="hey pikaka"  pikaka voice     # any phrase, no training
PIKAKA_WAKE_WORD=""          pikaka voice     # push-to-talk instead (Enter, speak, Enter)
```

The matcher is ~15 transparent lines with a deterministic eval; it accepts cross-script
variants (`"pikaka pikaka,ぴかぴか"`). A trained openWakeWord model is the efficient v2 upgrade.

**A beautiful voice.** Out of the box it uses macOS `say` — and Pikaka auto-picks the nicest
voice you have, preferring a downloaded Premium/Enhanced one (System Settings ▸ Accessibility
▸ Spoken Content ▸ System Voice) over the robotic built-ins. For the real neural upgrade,
install [Kokoro](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro) — a fully local, offline British-butler
voice that's picked up automatically, no env var needed:

```bash
uv pip install '.[voice-neural]'          # neural Kokoro (bm_george); pulls torch (~2GB)
```

Override either engine with `PIKAKA_VOICE` (a `say` voice name, or a Kokoro voice like `bf_emma`).

## Phone to laptop

```bash
pip install -e '.[telegram]'
# message @BotFather, /newbot, put the token in .env, then:
make telegram
```

Text your bot from anywhere and your laptop runs the turn — long-polling, so no
public URL or webhook. Set `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER` to lock it to just you.

## Brief me on my week (Apple Calendar + Mail)

```bash
PIKAKA_APPLE_TOOLS=1 make brief      # macOS; grant the permission prompts once
```

Pikaka reads your **real** Calendar.app (including events invited by email) and
recent Apple Mail, cross-references your memory, and writes a focus-first briefing
with clickable `message://` links. Cron it for a morning greeting:

```
30 7 * * *  cd ~/pikaka-agent && make brief
```

It runs through the normal harness, so it animates on the dashboard like any turn.

## Mirror created events to Google Calendar

The local SQLite database and `calendar.ics` stay authoritative. To also write
`create_event` results to Google Calendar, install the opt-in extra and configure
[Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc):

```bash
pip install -e '.[gcal]'
# Keep the downloaded client file OUTSIDE the repo — it is only an input to
# gcloud, which stores the resulting credentials in ~/.config/gcloud/.
gcloud auth application-default login \
  --client-id-file=~/.config/pikaka/gcal-client.json \
  --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events
PIKAKA_GOOGLE_CALENDAR=1 pikaka
```

Nothing secret ever needs to live in the repo: the client file is read once by
`gcloud`, and the credentials it mints land in `~/.config/gcloud/`. (`.gitignore`
also blocks `credentials.json` and `*token*.json` as a second line of defence.)

The target defaults to the signed-in user's `primary` calendar; set
`PIKAKA_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` for another calendar. `list_events` still reads the
local database. Google failures never roll back the local event, and attendee
notifications are suppressed (`sendUpdates=none`).

## Connect MCP servers

```bash
pip install -e '.[mcp]'
```

Create `.pikaka/mcp.json` and any Model Context Protocol server's tools appear to
the agent, namespaced `<server>_<tool>` (and in the dashboard's Tools ▸ MCP tab):

```json
{"servers": [{"name": "fs", "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]}]}
```

**Node-free demo** — a tiny self-contained Python MCP server ships in the repo:

```bash
cp examples/mcp.demo.json .pikaka/mcp.json   # points at examples/mcp_demo_server.py
make dashboard                               # demo_word_count / demo_reverse_text appear in Tools
```

Same pattern scales to any server, yours or a vendor's — no changes to Pikaka's code.
