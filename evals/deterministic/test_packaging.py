"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — what actually ships, and what a test is allowed to read.

Two failures found on 2026-07-31, both invisible to every other test because
every other test runs from a git checkout on the maintainer's machine.

1. THE WHEEL SHIPPED NO SKILLS. `pyproject.toml` packages `pikaka`, but the
   bundled skills live in `skills/` at the REPO ROOT, so `pip install
   pikaka-agent` produced a Pikaka with zero procedural memory — one of the four
   pillars, silently absent. The dashboard shipped fine (it lives under
   `pikaka/ops/static`), which is exactly why nobody noticed: the thing you can
   see worked. Nothing here can catch a broken wheel by inspecting a checkout,
   so these tests pin the two halves of the fix instead — the build config that
   copies the folder in, and the lookup that finds it once it's there.

2. THE TEST SUITE READ THE DEVELOPER'S `.env`. `pikaka/config.py` calls
   load_dotenv() at import, so a stale `PIKAKA_GRAPH_WORKFLOWS=1` routed every
   scripted turn through the triage graph, spent one extra model call, and
   failed 8 tests that were green in CI. A suite whose result depends on an
   untracked file is not deterministic — it is a suite that lies in whichever
   direction the local machine happens to point.
